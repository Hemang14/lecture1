    <h2><b>Audience Review</b></h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="grid-item">Everything about this show is brilliant. Terrific story that shows how far a family is willing to go to stay together & stay alive despite increasing obstacles. The acting is top-notch with Jason Bateman & Laura Linney at the top of their game. Then there is the standout that is Ruth who can drop an F-bomb like no one else, played brilliantly by Julia Garner. Another knockout performance in S3 is Tom Pelphrey playing Wendy's brother, Ben.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">I totally agree with Alphonse! Excellent series! Fresh off of Narcos and El Chapo the old Cartel team is back in action. Temperature turned down a bit from the territory killings but a story line that will keep you glued to your set.I lived in a area that had similar characters and the acting and cast selection is superb. You will quickly fall in love with some of the locals and there are enough bad guys to hate.Order plenty of popcorn you won't want to miss a minute of this show.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">I have no idea how or why this show got so many 5 star reviews! Ozark is excruciatingly slow, cumbersome and monotonous. It all too often feels ridiculous and unbelievable; it presents itself as a high-end crime drama with a top-rank cast, but it is painfully dull and mediocre. It fails to create any semblance of natural tension; it is neither engaging, moralistic or tragic and just leaves you feeling flat and empty!If you want a gritty, enjoyable and captivating crime drama not desperately lacking in all those aforementioned qualities, try Peaky Blinders!</div>

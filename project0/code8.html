    <h2><b>Audience Review</b></h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="grid-item">A Netflix original from a few weeks ago starring former CW stars Robbie Amell (from The Flash) & cousin Stephen (Arrow). Set in a world where enhanced individuals exist & segmented into their various traits (ones who can manipulate electricity or fire, mind control, strength, etc.) who were once a vibrant part of the labor force now find themselves marginalized because of the encroachment of automation & only able to find jobs on the slide & even then if they don't have the proper documentation.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">Astonishingly powerful, well paced, action-packed, thrilling, moving, full of courage with a well-written and directed story from the heart. I love these type of Sci-fi films and Code 8 is definitely a must-watch. Outstandingly imaginative and thought-provoking!!! Amazing is words I can describe that why the heck had I never heard of this movie before? Hollywood should produce more like this. For sure deserves its recognition.Such an awesome hidden rare gem especially for a low-budget film it can definitely pack a punch. It's like you're watching a high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime series. That's how fascinating it is. So clever!!! True cinematic entertainment!!! 10/10</div>
      <div class="grid-item">An interesting take on the exhausted superpower genre.Good performances from most of the cast and a pretty good story. The movie manages to keep a realistic edge throughout and deals with some heartfelt and human emotions.The CGI is polished without being overdone and theres plenty of action for the easily bored.Code 8 kept me interested mostly but I felt it was maybe a little flat towards the end although a highlight was the depth of seriousness shown through the cast performances.</div>

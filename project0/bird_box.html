    <h2><b>Audience Review</b></h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="grid-item">Personally I believe this was a very intense psychological indepth thriller about how most people live in society today, blind folded and guarded in order to avoid real emotions, real connection, and with perpetual fears that can be real but most of the times are untouchable and all created by the panic and anxieties within of things we will never see.</div>
      <div class="grid-item">I just watched Bird Box last night, directly after watching A Quiet Place for the first time. They really are nothing alike, other than they are both high concept movies that don't hold up to logic or scrutiny, but most people who watch this sort of thing are happy to agree just to not let their minds go there and spoil it for themselves</div>
      <div class="grid-item">The movie is gripping, crisp and concise. I watched this move in the comforts of my home on Netflix and I guess this made it more exciting and i sat completely engrossed in the movie. I think it is one of those movies that is best for individual (or at home) viewing experience. It was an all out Sandra Bullock movie and she doesn't miss a beat!</div>

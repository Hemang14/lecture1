            <div>A. I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.</div>
            <div>B. Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.</div>
            <div>C. Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.</div>
            <div>D. So many books, so little time.</div>
            <div>E. Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.</div>
            <div>F. A room without books is like a body without a sou.</div>
            <div>G. You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,Love like you'll never be hurt,Sing like there's nobody listening,And live like it's heaven on earth.</div>
            <div>H. You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.</div>
            <div>I. you only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.</div>
            <div>J. Be the change that you wish to see in the world..</div>
            <div>K. Be the change that you wish to see in the world.In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on..</div>
            <div>L. Don’t walk in front of me… I may not followDon’t walk behind me… I may not lead Walk beside me… just be my friend.</div>
